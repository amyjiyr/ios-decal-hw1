import UIKit


//: ## Q1: Optionals
class Words {
    var wordA : String!
    var wordB : String!
    
    init (wordA: String?, wordB: String?) {
        self.wordA = wordA
        self.wordB = wordB
    }

//: ### Are the values passed in to the **init** function and those set to the instance
//: ### variables the same type? If not, why?


//: Yes


//: ## Q2: Variable Types and Function Types
    class func arePalindromes(_ words: [String]) -> Bool {
        let reversedWords = words.map() {String($0.characters.reversed())}
        let numElements = words.count
        
        for i in 0 ... numElements-1 {
            if words[i] != reversedWords[i] {
                return false
            }
        }
        return true
    }
//: ### Why does the compiler dislike the **for loop**? Fix it.
//: ### What else is wrong with this function? You may have to refer to (but **not**
//: ### change) the code at the very bottom. Debug the function.

//: Because a for loop should have the syntax for i in 0 ... instead of ..>, also the index is off by 1: it starts with 0 so it should end in len-1
//: this function should be a class function since it's called using Words.arePalindromes(), so we have to add the word class in front of func. Also, the function should return a boolean value in all cases, so we should return true at the end

//: should make this into a class function for it to be called, also index is off, also should return something even if false is not checked


//: ## Q3: More Functions and Object Initialization
    func isAnagram() -> Bool {
        var countLetters = [Character : Int]() //Line X
        let lenA = self.wordA.characters.count
        let lenB = self.wordB.characters.count
        
        if lenA != lenB {
            return false
        }
        
        var arrA = Array(self.wordA.characters)
        var arrB = Array(self.wordB.characters)
        
        for i in 0...lenA-1 {
            let letter = arrA[i]
            if let val = countLetters[letter] { //Line Y
                countLetters[letter] = val + 1
            } else {
                countLetters[letter] = 1
            }
        }
        
        for i in 0...lenB-1 {
            let letter = arrB[i]
            if let val = countLetters[letter] {
                countLetters[letter] = val - 1
            } else {
                return false
            }
        }
        
        for (_, count) in countLetters {
            if count != 0 {
                return false
            }
        }
        
        return true
    }
//: ### What is the problem with declaring **countLetters** as we do in **Line X**,
//: ### and then using it in **Line Y**? Fix it (by only changing **Line X**).
//: ### What else is wrong with this function? You may have to refer to (but **not**
//: ### change) the code at the very bottom. Debug the function.


//: countLetters should be a dictionary, and a dictionary declaration has syntax var name = [key type, var type]()
//: this function is an instance function since it's called after creating an instance of Words, so we should not have the word class in front of func. Also, it's missing a return value outside the for loops. Finally, constants should be declared using let and not var. We should also change the last for loop so that the first parameter inside for() does not matter.
